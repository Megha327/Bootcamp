		<h1>Define Doctype</h1>

		<p>
			-> The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML 
				document, before the <html> tag.
				<br>
			->	The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction 
				to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.
				<br>
			-> Always add the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to your HTML documents,
				 so that the browser knows what type of document to expect.
